## Problem

We are modifying files and folders direcly on the file server. With this
practice there is a risk that changes in our folder structure, such as renaming,
moving or deleting folders have undesired effects. For example, a link to a
folder will be broken once the folder has been renamed. Or a script will not
work any more because an input file or folder has been renamed or moved.
Therefore, it is important to know what changes have been made to files and
folders on the server. 

## Permanent Tracking Is Not an Option

According to our IT consultant it would be possible to let the operating system
track such changes. However, this would slow down the server so much that this
is not an option.

## Proposal of a Simple Solution

We propose the following "hand-made" and "simple" solution to track changes:
Once per day (preferably during the night) we run a script. This script gets a
full list of files and folders that are currently stored on the server. This
list does not only contain the paths to the files and folders but also
additional information such as file sizes, times of last access and owners of
the files. All these information are written to a text file.

These text files allow to

* quickly search for a file or folder by just searching the text file. Even
though these files have a size of about 50 Megabytes, searching these files
using a good text editor is much more efficient than searching the whole file
server.

* compare text files referring to different days. Using the tools provided by
professional version control software can support the comparison. 

## Supporting Functions

This package contains a set of functions that aim at supporting the approach
described above.
